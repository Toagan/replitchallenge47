This is a simple **Top Trumps** game built using Python. The game allows users to pick a character, choose a stat, and compare it against a computer's randomly selected character. The game can be extended to allow users to add new characters dynamically, and features a comparison system for deciding the winner.

## Features

- Compare your character's stats with the computer's random character.
- Supports multiple rounds of gameplay in a loop.
- Option to add new characters dynamically with custom stats.
  
## How to Play

1. The game starts by displaying the available characters.
2. The player picks a character, and the computer randomly selects one as well.
3. The player chooses a stat (e.g., Intelligence, Speed, Guile, Baldness Level).
4. The game compares the chosen stat between the player's character and the computer's character to determine the winner.
5. The game loops until the player decides to quit.
